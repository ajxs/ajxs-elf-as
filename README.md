# ajxs-elf-as

A basic general purpose ELF format Assembler.
Assembly syntax is based on the GNU assembler, most directives supported by `GCC`/`as` should be supported. Assembles relocatable ELF object files.
This project is for educational purposes only and does not intend to create a fully-featured assembler suitable for production use, however the functionality is intended to be close to parity with a production assembler. For clarification, this does not create executable binaries, it creates *relocatable* object binaries, which can be linked into an executable with an ELF compatible linker. The decision to target this functionality was made on the basis that it was easier to create a useful utility.

Currently a minimal set of the MIPS32r6 instruction set has been implemented.

## Building
This project requires GNU `flex` and `bison` in order to be built from source. Binaries are readily available for most Linux distros.
The target architecture is configured at build time by setting the `ARCH` environment variable. e.g.

```
# Build targeting MIPS.
export ARCH=mips
```

## Usage
Example command-line usage:
```
./ajxs-{ARCH}-elf-as --output=./output.elf input_file.S
```

## What does not work
- Does not support subsections.
- Does not support legacy instructions deprecated in, or prior to `mips32r6`.
- *Currently* does not support expression expansion in assembler directives. However, this will eventually be implemented.
- Does not support the `.set` directives used by GAS.
- `.align` directive functionality within `.text` sections may be incorrect. GAS implementation of this directive varies by architecture. This is an area that needs more research. See: [Using as: 7.3 .align](https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/as/Align.html)
